past Eve and Adam's, etc. No, not that one.

Before returning from the in-laws, I did [8km in Louisville/Jeff today](https://brouter.m11n.de/#map=16/38.2674/-85.7317/standard&lonlats=-85.743141,38.273144;-85.739574,38.266178;-85.727445,38.264502;-85.722372,38.26671;-85.720217,38.269913) --- from a [lovely coffee/board game shop](https://www.gameandcoffee.com/) on the Indiana side, across the [Big Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_Bridge), along the riverwalk and marina, and back --- in 58', a nice and easy 7'/km pace. 

Then the hubby and I drove the six hours north, through approximately one million square miles of desolate Indiana wilderness, inhabited only by preachy billboards, crosses, and corn. I think this was considerably harder on my body than the run, which makes me really, really happy and giggly.

We did stop in Indy for lunch. My [usual go-to](https://www.yelp.com/biz/10th-street-diner-indianapolis) is closed Sunday, so I found [this place](https://www.easyriderindy.com/) that does some pretty good vegan tacos. Walking back to the car, I discovered there's a local goth folk band called [the Public Universal Friend.](https://publicuniversalfriend.band/) Yes, it is fronted by a trans girl, and yes, their music explores the conflict between transness and religion. I'm in love.

Also, I read [*The Persistence of Vision*](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persistence_of_Vision_(novella)>) by John Varley. 
I originally bought the collection in Chicago for [another story](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/238174/short-story-involving-symbiotic-space-suit-and-a-war-against-aliens), but ended up reading *Overdrawn at the Memory Bank* (of MST3K fame) and the titular novella. And, holy *shit*. It's rare for me to get a picture of extrasensory phenomena so clearly. And it's rarer still for me to feel actual love emanating off the page. Maybe that's because of trauma, I don't know. But that ending...it's up there with *Hell is the Absence of God,* in the running for my favorite ever. *Wow.*

It's nice to be home. And it's nice to realize that I'm really getting in deep. Every step I take makes me so, so excited that I'm doing this. It feels like destiny, a purpose which I haven't had in a long time. It's fucking amazing. Highly recommended. I love my life.
