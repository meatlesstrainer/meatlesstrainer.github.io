Today I woke up from a rather pleasant midday nap to find out that the Mariners <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/eugenio-suarez-d-backs-trade">traded Geno Su&aacute;rez</a> for a bag of chips and a half-eaten ham sandwich.

This incensed me so thoroughly that I went out and ran a 3.5-minute <abbr>PB</abbr> <abbr>5K.</abbr> It was also a big fat milestone --- my first sub-30 since I started HRT, years and years ago. (And to point out how big of a difference it makes, my <em>slowest</em> testosterone-aided <abbr>5K</abbr> was 28:45.)
