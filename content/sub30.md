Today I woke up from a rather pleasant midday nap to find out that the Mariners [traded Geno Su&aacute;rez](https://www.mlb.com/news/eugenio-suarez-d-backs-trade) for a bag of chips and a half-eaten ham sandwich.

This incensed me so thoroughly that I went out and ran a 3.5-minute <abbr>PB</abbr> <abbr>5K.</abbr> It was also a big fat milestone --- my first sub-30 since I started HRT, years and years ago. (And to point out how big of a difference it makes, my *slowest* testosterone-aided <abbr>5K</abbr> was 28:45.)

That's the big thing I'm proud of this week. But it should be noted that on Monday I ran about 7.5K, which is by fiat the longest run I've recorded since HRT.
